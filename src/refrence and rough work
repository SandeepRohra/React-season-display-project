//constructor is always used and called when we use state
  constructor(props) {
    // super should must be called and props should be passed to work with state
    // if its confusing reffer lacture 57-60 of steives course
    super(props)
    //1) it is the perfect time to iitialise state

    //2) This is only time we use this.state mns only when we initalise it in constructor function
    this.state = { lat: null, errorMessage: '' }
  }

  this can also be used but we preffer what we have done there in indexx.js
